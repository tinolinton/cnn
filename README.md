# Image Classifier CNN

**Automating Digital Forensics Using Deep Learning-Based Image Classification**

---

## Research Questions

This project aims to address the following research questions:

1. **Can deep learning-based image classification techniques be used to identify manipulation artifacts in images?**
2. **How effective are these approaches in classifying images based on their manipulation artifact characteristics?**
3. **What are the limitations and challenges associated with using deep learning-based image classification techniques for digital forensics?**

## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate the identification of image manipulation artifacts for digital forensic purposes. By using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to classify images based on their artifact characteristics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or 3.10
- Required libraries (install via `pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tinolinton/cnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cnn
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing images into the appropriate directories (`train`, `val`, `test`).
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks provided to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance:
   - [EVENING190125SUNDAY[1].ipynb](EVENING190125SUNDAY[1].ipynb)
   - `latest wit resnet functioning.ipynb`
   - [optimized.ipynb](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
