## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or 3.10
- Required libraries (install via `pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tinolinton/cnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cnn
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing images into the appropriate directories (`train`, `val`, `test`).
2. Run the Jupyter notebook provided to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance:
   - [project.ipynb](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)

### Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and model building.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize class distribution, sample images, and basic statistics.
4. **Image Analysis**: Analyze image size, aspect ratio, contrast, and brightness distributions.
5. **Preprocessing**: Apply custom preprocessing techniques, including histogram equalization and HOG feature extraction.
6. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features using PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
7. **Model Building**: Define and train different CNN models (Custom CNN, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2).
8. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
9. **Saving and Loading Models**: Save the trained model and load it for future use.
10. **Validation**: Validate the model on new images and classify them.

### Example Usage

To classify a new image using the trained model:

1. Load the trained model:

   ```python
   model_path = 'best_model.h5'
   model = load_trained_model(model_path)
   ```

2. Preprocess and classify the image:
   ```python
   uploaded_image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
   class_label, confidence = classify_image(uploaded_image_path, model)
   print(f'The uploaded image is classified as {class_label} with a confidence of {confidence:.2f}')
   ```

### Problems This Model Can Solve

1. **Identification of Image Manipulation Artifacts**:

   - The model can detect and classify various types of manipulation artifacts in images, such as splicing, copy-move, and other forms of tampering. This is crucial for digital forensics to determine the authenticity of images.

2. **Automated Image Classification**:

   - The model can automatically classify images into different categories based on their manipulation artifact characteristics. This can be used in various applications, including content moderation, digital forensics, and media verification.

3. **Performance Evaluation of Image Classification Techniques**:

   - The model provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of different image classification techniques. This helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Data Visualization**:

   - By using techniques like PCA and t-SNE, the model can reduce the dimensionality of image data and visualize it. This is useful for exploratory data analysis and understanding the distribution of different classes in the dataset.

5. **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**:

   - The model includes preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images, as well as feature extraction techniques like histogram equalization and HOG feature extraction. These steps enhance the quality of the input data and improve the performance of the classification model.
