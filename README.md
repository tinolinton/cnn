# Image Classifier CNN  
**Automating Digital Forensics Using Deep Learning-Based Image Classification**

---

## Research Questions  
This project aims to address the following research questions:

1. **Can deep learning-based image classification techniques be used to identify manipulation artifacts in images?**  
2. **How effective are these approaches in classifying images based on their manipulation artifact characteristics?**  
3. **What are the limitations and challenges associated with using deep learning-based image classification techniques for digital forensics?**
